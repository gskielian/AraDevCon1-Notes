Aim to to transition to ASICs but FPGAs are being used for the prototype.

## Intro

Aim is to create:

* Ara Compliant Modules

What is included:

* Examples of Spec Compliance
* Prototype modules design
* Module Templates
* Sample Code

MDK does not address: 
* Endos
* Module shell aesthetic design

## Organization of the MDK:

1. Licensing
2. Industrial Design
3. Mechanical Layout
4. Power -- flexible power structure, multiple batteries, hotswap of batteries (hotswap)
5. Network Stack -- Mipi Unipro Working Group Chair Presentation 
6. Software Stack -- 
7. System-Level Functions -- EPM control 
8. Environmental
9. Module Marketplace
10. Regulatory Certification

## Ara Architecture Definitions

#### XYZ definition:
* Z outward normal from the "front screen" (implied front is main screen side)
* Y up 
* right (when looking at front screen)

#### Endo Slots Dissection:
* Endo Spines
* Endo Ribs
* Interfaec Block
* PowerPads (Gold)
* Capacitative Pads


## How do I get an MDK?

* projectara.com/mdk

* Git code repo -- *Coming Soon*
